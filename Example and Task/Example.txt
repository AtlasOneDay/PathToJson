Provide file hierarchy representation of the selected path in JSON format.
 
The solution should allow picking any folder from the file system. Than selected folder should be converted to JSON.
 
JSON file should contain Name and Creation Date of the selected folder. If a folder has subfolders, then the same info should be present for each of subs. If the folder has files inside, then File Name, Size and Full Path for each of sub-file should be present.
You should implement your task using some UI frameworks. Like WPF or ASP.NET MVC and send it back one more time.

It should not be a console application.
